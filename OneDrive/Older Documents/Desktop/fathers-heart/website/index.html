            <p>What if the stories we tell about God helped children feel safe, kind, and deeply loved?</p>
            
            <p>In The Father's Heart Series, Ansilo Boff re-introduces children to the gentle, forgiving Father that Jesus revealed — not a God of punishment or fear, but one of peace, mercy, and inclusion.</p>
            
            <p>Through tender storytelling and luminous watercolor illustrations, each book turns everyday moments into spiritual discoveries: forgiving a friend, using kind words, feeling peace during storms, sharing what we have, and welcoming others at our table.</p>
            
            <p>Every page helps children (and parents) unlearn fear and rediscover love.</p>
            
            <p>Because when we see others — and God — through Jesus' eyes, the world becomes a brighter, kinder place.</p>
            
            <p>Perfect for bedtime reading, family devotion, or Sunday-school story time, The Father's Heart Series nurtures young hearts to grow in empathy, peace, and joy.</p>
