              The Question That Shatters Everything
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Jesus asked a question so simple, so direct, that it should have ended the debate forever:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 pl-6 py-4 my-8 italic text-xl text-gray-200" style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
              "Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, 
              will give him a serpent?"
            </blockquote>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The answer is obvious: <strong>No loving father would do such a thing.</strong> Yet when the Israelites begged for food 
              in the wilderness, Yahweh sent venomous serpents that killed many. When they asked for water, Yahweh 
              gave them a stone to strike.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Jesus wasn't speaking abstractly. <strong>He was showing very clearly that Yahweh's actions proved he was not the father 
              of the Israelites.</strong> There's no sugar-coating this: <em>Jesus was saying their true Father had been replaced by an imposter.</em> 
              This alone is clear and damning proof that Yahweh cannot be the Father of Jesus.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              But the contradictions run deeper than a single question. <strong>They reveal two fundamentally different beings 
              operating under completely different systems.</strong>

              The Blood Economy
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Yahweh's system was built on blood. <strong>Rivers of it.</strong> The temple became a slaughterhouse where animals 
              died daily to appease divine wrath. But it wasn't just animals. <strong>Yahweh's commands extended to humans.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Consider this chilling command: <strong>"The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me"</strong> (Exodus 22:29). 
              Human sacrifice. Yahweh commanded it. Even if you could "redeem" your child with an animal substitute 
              if you could afford it, the command itself reveals a god who accepts—even demands—the sacrifice of children.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This same Yahweh accused other nations of child sacrifice, calling it so abominable that it justified 
              genocide. Yet He then asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac. <strong>The hypocrisy is staggering.</strong> The nations were 
              evil for doing what Yahweh commanded Abraham to do. Abraham was rewarded for being willing to do the 
              most abominable action imaginable. <em>You may be thinking, "Thankfully, he was stopped at the last minute!"</em> 
              Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Jephthah, who had to go ahead and sacrifice his daughter to Yahweh.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              The blood economy wasn't just about atonement—<strong>it was about control.</strong> More laws meant more sins. More 
              sins meant more sacrifices. More sacrifices meant more wealth flowing to the temple. <em>It was a system 
              designed to perpetuate guilt and generate profit.</em>

              The Darkness Where Yahweh Dwells
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Yahweh consistently appears shrouded in thick darkness, clouds, and gloom. Moses met Yahweh in darkness 
              on Sinai. The Psalms describe Yahweh making darkness His covering. But Jesus' Father dwells in 
              unapproachable light—in Him there is no darkness at all.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This isn't poetic language or metaphor. <strong>It's a direct contradiction that reveals two fundamentally 
              different beings.</strong> One dwells in darkness. The other is pure light. One commands genocide. The other 
              commands love. One demands blood sacrifice. The other offers unconditional acceptance.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              When Jesus said, "If you've seen Me, you've seen the Father," <strong>He wasn't adding another voice to the 
              chorus. He was replacing all the others.</strong> The character of God is not a collage of contradictory verses. 
              <em>It's a single face—the face Jesus revealed.</em>

              Jesus didn't come to fulfill Yahweh's law. <strong>He came to expose it.</strong> Throughout His ministry, Jesus 
              systematically contradicted Yahweh's commands.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Yahweh commanded oath-taking as a religious duty. Jesus declared all oath-taking forbidden, calling 
              it <strong>"evil" and "from the evil one."</strong>
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Yahweh commanded vengeance: "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." Jesus commanded forgiveness: <strong>"Love your 
              enemies, do good to those who hate you."</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Yahweh demanded blood sacrifice for forgiveness. <strong>Jesus forgave freely, instantly, without payment.</strong> 
              He forgave a paralyzed man before a single drop of blood was spilled. He forgave His executioners 
              from the cross itself.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              This wasn't evolution or accommodation. <strong>This was open rebellion against a system Jesus came to dismantle.</strong>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              One of the most insidious doctrines is "original sin"—the idea that you're born guilty, inheriting 
              Adam and Eve's transgression through your bloodline. But Ezekiel crushes this doctrine:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 pl-6 py-4 my-8 italic text-xl text-gray-200" style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
              "The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity" (Ezekiel 18:20)

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The true God rejects the vile notion that innocence can bear guilt by bloodline. <em>How absurd—how utterly 
              obscene—the idea that you might be held eternally accountable for Adam and Eve's ancient transgressions.</em> 
              <strong>This doctrine is nothing less than theological terrorism designed to enslave humanity under a perpetual 
              cloud of guilt and fear.</strong>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              But here's where it gets worse. Jesus warned about false prophets who would come after Him. <strong>And Paul, 
              whether intentionally or not, rebuilt the very system Jesus came to dismantle.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Paul didn't build on Jesus' foundation. <strong>He built on Yahweh's.</strong> In one sweeping theological maneuver, 
              Paul turned Jesus into the very thing Jesus opposed—<em>a sacrificial offering in a system Jesus came to 
              destroy.</em>
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 pl-6 py-4 my-8 italic text-xl text-gray-200" style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
              "God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith." (Romans 3:25)
            </blockquote>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Jesus didn't need a cross to forgive. <strong>He forgave freely. Unasked. On the spot.</strong> No rituals. No intermediaries. 
              No transaction. From the cross, He cried: <em>"Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing."</em>
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But Paul? Paul told us forgiveness only flows when you believe in blood. <strong>"Without the shedding of blood, 
              there is no forgiveness"</strong> (Hebrews 9:22). Really? Because Jesus forgave before a single drop was spilled.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The contradictions are stark:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300" style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
              <li><strong>Jesus taught:</strong> forgive without payment. <strong>Paul taught:</strong> no forgiveness without blood.</li>
              <li><strong>Jesus taught:</strong> love enemies. <strong>Paul taught:</strong> hand them over to Satan.</li>
              <li><strong>Jesus warned:</strong> beware false prophets. <strong>Paul declared:</strong> himself the last and greatest apostle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Paul hijacked Jesus' story and twisted it into a theological death cult.</strong> And it worked. Paul's letters 
              exploded across the early church—portable, quotable, pre-packaged theology. Meanwhile, the Gospels lagged 
              behind, decades later, inevitably tainted by Paul's influence.

              The Mercy That Yahweh Rejected
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Buried deep in the Old Testament, there's a stunning contradiction. Hosea attributes these words to Yahweh:
            </p>
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-cyan-500 pl-6 py-4 my-8 italic text-xl text-gray-200" style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
              "For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings." (Hosea 6:6)
            </blockquote>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The same Yahweh who instituted the temple system, who demanded rivers of animal blood, who enjoyed the 
              "aroma pleasing" of burnt offerings, suddenly claims He doesn't want sacrifices after all. Some scholars 
              say the correct translation is "never"—"For I desire mercy, never sacrifice."
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Jeremiah goes even further, claiming that when God brought Israel out of Egypt, He never commanded burnt 
              offerings and sacrifices. The entire Passover system—the lamb's blood on doorposts—was never commanded 
              by the true God, according to Jeremiah.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              These contradictions suggest that even within the Old Testament, there were voices trying to correct the

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Jesus burned down the altar of retribution. He burned the ledger that kept track of sins and sacrifices.

              no third option. If we claim to follow Jesus but still worship the punishing god He came to expose, <em>we've 
              missed the point of His teachings entirely.</em>
